The content of this repository is available in <https://blog.iany.me>.

I use a [script](https://github.com/doitian/blog-autobuild/blob/master/x.py) to convert this repository to a Hugo site, so that I can organize the contents in a comfort way.

The markdown files here take advantage of some features from iA Writer, such as [Content Blocks](https://ia.net/writer/support/general/content-blocks). I can get the best preview experience in iA Writer, however, I still can edit the files with any editor at hand, such as my favorite, Vim.
