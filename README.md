# Knowledge Base

The content of this folder is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/doitian/knowledge-base) and [Obsidian Publish](https://kb.iany.me/output/README)

I use a [script](https://github.com/doitian/blog-autobuild/blob/master/x.py) to convert this repository to a Hugo site, so that I can organize the contents in a comfort way. The Hugo site is published to [blog.iany.me](https://blog.iany.me).

The markdown files here take advantage of some features from Obsidian, such as embed markdown file and image. I can get the best preview experience in Obsidian, however, I still can edit the files with any editor at hand.
