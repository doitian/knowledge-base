## Repeatability

* Pseudo-concurrency
* Simulate external communication
* Deterministic

Eliminate any external randomness that cannot be controlled.

## Simulation Test

* Repeatable thus saving time to reproduce the bug.
* Explore the space more efficiently than the real world.
	* For example, simulating random network disconnection, power shortage.

## Challenges

* It takes efforts to keep deterministic
* Hard to implement test oracles in some apps to tell whether there's a bug.

## Interesting Observations

* Simply stopping and restarting in reverse order finds many bugs.
