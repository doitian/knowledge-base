#computer-science

> NP is the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, where the answer is "yes", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time.

There exists a verifier which can checks a solution is correct in polynomial time.

> The complexity class co-NP for which the answer “no” can be verified in polynomial time.

Verifier which checks the answer is wrong in polynomial time.
