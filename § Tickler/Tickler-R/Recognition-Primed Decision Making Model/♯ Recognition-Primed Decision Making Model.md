# Recognition-Primed Decision Making Model

#knowledge-management

* Recognition of goals, cues, expectancies and actions.
* Perform the actions if there's a pattern match. If there are several candidates, people usually try them one by one and adopt the first one which meets all the requirements.
* If the pattern is abnormal, analyze and collect more data, then rerun the loop.
