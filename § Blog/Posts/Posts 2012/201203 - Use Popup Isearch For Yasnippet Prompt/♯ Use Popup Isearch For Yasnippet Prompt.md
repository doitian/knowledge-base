# Use Popup Isearch For Yasnippet Prompt

#emacs

[Yasnippet][] tries functions in `yas/prompt-functions` when it needs user to select one choice, such as selecting snippets with the same trigger key, such as helper method `yas/choose-value`.

[popup][] is a visual popup interface library extracted from [auto-complete][] by its author. It has better look and feel than all the built-in `yas/prompt-functions`. Also it is easy to customize, and its isearch mode is very efficient, the items are filtered on-the-fly when typing.

The integration is easy. Load `popup.el`, implement one prompt function and
add it to `yas/prompt-functions`.
