# Fix iOS App Store Family Purchase Sharing

#iOS

I have created a family group using the Apple ID *A*, and the account *B* is a member. However, I can't download apps purchased by *A* in the device logged in by *B*. Today, I finally find out the cause. The Purchase Sharing setting in account *B* is incorrect, which is by accident set to share as *A* and I don't know why.

To fix it, just ensure every family member has set to share purchase as themselves in the Purchase Sharing setting.
