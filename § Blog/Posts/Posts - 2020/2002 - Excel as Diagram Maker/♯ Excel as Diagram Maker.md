# Excel as Diagram Maker

#screencast #power-tool

Excel is a full featured vector graphics app. It has bundled many shapes and styles, and even supports anchoring connectors to the shapes. All these features make Excel also a good diagram maker.

One of my favorite tips is grid snapping, it can save a lot of time to align shapes. I also recommend resizing the grid as small squares.

I have recorded a screencast for it. The video has demonstrated:

1. Resize the grid into small squares.
2. Insert a shape to open the *Shape Format* menu.
3. Enable snapping features in the *Align* menu.
4. Insert more shapes and add connectors.
