# Minimize any window into system tray in Windows

#windows

There are two apps both work for me in scoop extras bucket.

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install rbtray traymond
```

They both require running their background process first. Rbtray minimizes a window into system tray by right clicking the window minimization button, while traymond us shortcuts Win + Shift + Zã€‚

Rbtray has no its own system tray icon. Minimize a window and right click it to quit rbtray. Traymond has its own tray icon, use it to exit or restore all windows.
