# Save Web Articles via Inoreader

One of my favorite features of [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) is saving the article to external services, such as Evernote, OneDrive or Google Drive. I can archive the articles I liked for future references.

Inoreader even supports automatically fetching full text for truncated RSS feed. This is awesome to work with other web services. Many bookmarking and reading later services, such as Diigo, Instapaper and Pinboard, all provide RSS feed but without full text.

The Inoreader Pro subscribers can save the articles automatically by creating rules. For example, I have saved all of my bookmarks into Evernote.
