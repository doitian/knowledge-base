## Maching Learning

## Blockchain

- [Slasher: A Punitive Proof-of-Stake Algorithm - Ethereum Blog]( https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm/)

    - Signing Privileges/Validators is determined in early blocks.
    - Signing rewards claim is deferred.
    - Everyone can publish conflicting signing to claim cheater finder reward. Cheater looses rewards, reporter is incentivized by the reward.

    Slasher 从机制上迫使要获利就要不同分支上使用相同 key 做冲突签名，由于签名几乎不可伪造，所以任何人发现冲突后都可以同时在不同的分支上举报。
