# What I Touched This Week 2019-07-07


- [Atomics](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/atomics.html)

    > establishing a "happens before relationship" between parts of the program and the threads that are running them.

    > - *SeqCst*: all accesses on one thread that happen before and after a SeqCst access stay before and after it.
    > - *Acquire*: an acquire access ensures that every access after it stays after it.
    > - *Release*: a release access ensures that every access before it stays before it.

    > Keep a record of "stupid errors that took me more than 1 hour to solve"

    > "I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just confused".
