## Reading
### 1. Intentional Goals vs. Traditional Goal-Setting

The concept of "intentional goals" offers a powerful paradigm shift in personal development philosophy. Unlike traditional goals that focus on future outcomes, intentional goals center on who you want to *be* in the present moment.

**Key Insights**:
- Intentional goals function like **lighthouses**—providing direction rather than being destinations
- They transform every moment into an opportunity to serve your greater vision
- The "why does this matter?" exercise (asking five times) helps uncover deeper intentions
- Regular review processes ensure goals continue serving your core intentions

### 2. Cursor's Elite Engineering Culture

The deep dive into Cursor reveals a fascinating company culture built as a "haven for self-motivated individual contributors" where intense collaboration and product obsession drive innovation.

**Cultural Pillars**:
- **High-Agency Environment**: Individual contributors hold the highest status, making things happen through enthusiasm rather than management
- **"Fuzz" Rituals**: Silent, hour-long sessions where the entire team tries to break upcoming releases
- **Ceiling-First Design**: Building for the best developers rather than making incremental improvements
- **Self-Imposed Excellence**: No mandated hours, but meaningful percentage of team works extensively due to passion

### 3. Human-AI Collaboration in Knowledge Work

This topic explores the evolving role of humans in AI-augmented workflows, emphasizing that "approval is thinking" in the AI era.

**Collaboration Framework**:
- **Cognitive Handshake**: Using intuition and experience to approve AI's logic chains
- **Traffic Light System**:
  - **Green Zone**: AI-driven tasks and automation
  - **Yellow Zone**: AI as sparring partner for brainstorming and challenging ideas
  - **Red Zone**: Human sovereignty over value judgments, emotional expression, and final decisions
- **Studio Mindset**: Valuing ideas (Fleeting Notes) and final works (Permanent Notes) over raw information
