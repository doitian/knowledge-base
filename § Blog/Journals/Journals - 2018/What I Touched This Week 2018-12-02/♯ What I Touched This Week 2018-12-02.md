## Read Papers

- [Weekly Paper: Liberal Radicalism](ia-writer://open?path=/Locations/_Publish/§%20Blog/Posts/Posts%20-%202018/1812%20-%20Weekly%20Paper%20Liberal%20Radicalism/♯%20Weekly%20Paper%20Liberal%20Radicalism.md)
- Notes on 「[Blockchain Governance: Programming Our Future – Fred
  Ehrsam](https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/blockchain-governance-programming-our-future-c3bfe30f2d74)」

    - Why governance is important?
        - Change are most important in long term.
        - We have the opportunity to create vastly different power structures and program the future we want for ourselves.
    - Two Critical Components of Governance
        1. Incentives
        2. Mechanisms for coordination

    - Author's options

        - [To revert The DAO attack] requires higher friction through  off-chain coordination and hard forking instead of on-chain coordination with no forking.

    - My thoughts

        - New developers have little incentive to work on Bitcoin.
            - Public goods crowdfunding, such as crowdfunding by inflation.
        - Buying vs locking in Quadratic Voting.
            - How about voting by coindays?
