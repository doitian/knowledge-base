# What I Touched This Week 2018-12-09


* [On-Chain versus Off-Chain Computation, Turing Completeness and Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://continuations.com/post/180584573645/on-chain-versus-off-chain-computation-turing)

    Off-Chain computation, On-Chain verification.

* [Blockchain Interoperability: Cosmos vs. Polkadot – Dave Kajpust – Medium](https://medium.com/@davekaj/blockchain-interoperability-cosmos-vs-polkadot-48097d54d2e2)

    Consensus: Cosmos uses DPoS, Polkadot uses hybrid PBFT / Aurand.

    Network security:

    * With Polkadot the network security is pooled and shared. This means that individual chains can leverage collective security without having to start from scratch to gain traction and trust.
    * Cosmos uses governance to decide whether or not the main Cosmos Hub should connect to a Cosmos Zone.

* [9 most useful piece of advice I’ve received](https://medium.com/@collinmathilde/9-most-useful-piece-of-advice-ive-received-15ebb7a47008)

    My fav:

    * There are 2 types of decisions: 1-way door decisions and 2-way door decisions. Be involved with the former, but less and less in the latter.
    * Before you make an offer to someone, think about whether you’d like to have 10 times as many people like them in your company.
    * It’s better to have a hole in your org. than an asshole.

* [Go Fast and Break Things: The Difference Between Reversible and Irreversible Decisions](https://www.fs.blog/2018/04/reversible-irreversible-decisions/)

    It is the same with the first advice I listed above.

* [26 medium to hard Rust questions with complete explanations](https://dtolnay.github.io/rust-quiz)
* [The True Cost of Rewrites | 8th Light](https://8thlight.com/blog/doug-bradbury/2018/11/27/true-cost-rewrites.html)

    ```
    True cost = estimation *
              ( 1 + catch up + undiscovered + enhancement )
    ```

* [Six Years With a Distraction-Free iPhone](https://medium.com/s/story/six-years-with-a-distraction-free-iphone-8cf5eb4f97e3)

    The author deleted all distracting apps, which is too aggressive. My
    solution is to disable the notifications, and put all the apps in one folder,
    so it is too inconvenient to open them.

* [Getting Your Point Across: Tech Team and Non-Tech Team Communication Tips](https://8thlight.com/blog/cat-mcloughlin/2018/12/04/getting-your-point-across.html)

    Be honest and transparent.

* [“Writing is Thinking”—an annotated twitter thread](https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/writing-is-thinking-an-annotated-twitter-thread-2a75fe07fade)

    My thoughts:
    
    * Write it down before any argue.
    * Writing helps to think throughly.
    
* [Tips for High Availability – Netflix Technology Blog – Medium](https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog/tips-for-high-availability-be0472f2599c)
* [Looking at ownership in the EVM – Kelvin Fichter – Medium](https://medium.com/@kelvinfichter/looking-at-ownership-in-the-evm-6e6914d341d)

    > ETH is the only thing that Ethereum really recognizes as an asset that can be owned. Everything else is relegated to the land of “virtual” ownership
