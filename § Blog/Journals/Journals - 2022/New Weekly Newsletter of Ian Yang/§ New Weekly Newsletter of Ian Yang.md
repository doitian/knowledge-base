I used to list all things happened in the week. It became a burden, so I stopped writing the weekly journal about 2 years ago.

I read the book Free Your Inner Nonfiction Writer by Johanna Rothman and it inspired me a lot about improving my writing. One tip I learned is the rule of three. Itâ€™s much easier to pick 3 things I feel like the most. So I decide to resume writing the weekly journal. I use Revue because it simplifies the curating process.
