# What I Touched This Week 2020-09-19

I have read the book [Specifying Systems: The TLA+ Language and Tools for Hardware and Software Engineers](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3553759014) and several other books about painting.

* [Daily Painting: Paint Small and Often To Become a More Creative, Productive, and Successful Artist](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3553293627)
* [Perspective Made Easy](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3553765315)
* [Pencil Sketching](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3553762796)

My picks:

* [8 Cognitive Biases in Software Development](https://thevaluable.dev/cognitive-bias-software-development/)
    * What are cognitive biases and how they can pop up in our work, as software developers.
    * Different techniques to prevent these biases, to take more logical decisions.

## Technique

* [How Algorithms Are Changing What We Read Online](https://thewalrus.ca/how-algorithms-are-changing-what-we-read-online/)

    > But, on your phone, you scroll through what’s been selected for you. And that selection likely reflects a ruthless narrowing of editorial values and priorities.

* [The land before modern APIs](https://increment.com/apis/land-before-modern-apis/)

    > When we’re trying to build the future, it’s extremely helpful to look to the past.

## Programming

* [Your Language Sucks, It Doesn’t Matter](https://matklad.github.io//2020/09/13/your-language-sucks.html)

    This post describes the author's own pet theory of programming languages popularity.

    > Languages generally become popular when they bring innovative runtime, or when they have runtime exclusivity. The quality of the language itself is secondary.

* [Rust 2020: Testing](https://knowitlabs.no/rust-2020-testing-4ab3d80112ba)

    * Use the crate [`mockall`](https://github.com/asomers/mockall) to auto-generate a mocked implementation that I instantiate in my test.
    * But it turns out you can still do this, using the nightly compiler! Enter [Mocktopus](https://github.com/CodeSandwich/Mocktopus), a module-level mocking library.

* [Rust HTTP Testing with httpmock | Alex Liesenfeld](https://alexliesenfeld.com/posts/2020/rust-http-testing-with-httpmock/)

    > According to the comparison matrix the most complete package is currently provided by [httpmock](https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock).

* [C++ vs Rust: an async Thread-per-Core story | by Glauber Costa | Sep, 2020 | Medium](https://medium.com/@glaubercosta_11125/c-vs-rust-an-async-thread-per-core-story-28c4b43c410c)
* [What killed Haskell, could kill Rust](https://gist.github.com/graninas/22ab535d2913311e47a742c70f1d2f2b/c4e1b25cefe673a0c1d1bec4c24690121f31fa21)

    An interesting essay about what Rust community should avoid.
