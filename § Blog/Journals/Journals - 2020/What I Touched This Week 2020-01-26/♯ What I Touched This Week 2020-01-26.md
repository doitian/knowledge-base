-   [Achieve High Productivity in Your Remote Team ](https://www.theremoteworksummit.com/improve-productivity-in-remote-team/)

    -   "Kudos. This section of the meeting is our time to thank or celebrate teammates who've been helpful or particularly awesome."
    -   "Each Friday afternoon, we have Show and Tell time scheduled."
