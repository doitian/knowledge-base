    * Read the title, the abstract, and the figures.
    * Read the intro, the conclusions, all figures and skim the rest.
    * Skim related work.
    * Read the paper but skip the math.
    * Read whole things **but skip parts that don't make sense**.
* Read to answer the questions:
    * What did authors try to accomplish.
    * What can you use yourself?
    * What other references do you want to follow?
* Math and code:
    * Re-derive/Re-implement from scratch.

- 无论是写永久笔记还是瞬时笔记，把句子写得尽量清楚、完整。这样在回顾笔记的时候自己的想法一目了然。
- 把所有的链接性语句也完整地写下来，这个过程可以更好地帮助自己发现思考中的漏洞，使得笔记内容更加严谨。
